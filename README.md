# Open-CV-with-Python
A hands on coding guide on Open CV with python from the basics and some mini projects. More coming soon!!

This repository starts from the basics of Open CV with Python with well documented and commented code, making it easier for the reader to understand the code.
I will be covering a good amount of projects on the go and keep the repository updated regularly. 
So, let's start coding!
